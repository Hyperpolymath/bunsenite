/* ATTRIBUTION */

This project stands on the shoulders of giants.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to:
  - Rust language and ecosystem
  - Nickel configuration language
  - Open source software movement
  - Free/libre software philosophy
  - Standards and best practices
  - Educational resources
  - Community support and mentorship

We are part of a larger movement toward:
  - Safer software (memory & type safety)
  - Reversible development (Git, version control)
  - Emotional safety (anxiety reduction, experimentation)
  - Political autonomy (community sovereignty)
  - Ethical technology (transparency, consent)

/* PHILOSOPHY */

"Software should be:
  - Safe (memory & type safety)
  - Traceable (reversibility)
  - Empowering (emotional safety)
  - Autonomous (political freedom)
  - Collaborative (community-driven)"

- Campaign for Cooler Coding and Programming

/* END */

Made with ❤️ by humans, for humans.
Politically autonomous software for emotionally safe development.
